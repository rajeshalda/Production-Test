_**Assistant**_

I'll help you convert this PowerShell script to Python. Let me analyze the script first and break it down into logical components.

The PowerShell script is a comprehensive meeting processor that:

1. **Authentication & Configuration**
   - Uses MSAL for Microsoft Graph API authentication
   - Handles Intervals API authentication
   - Uses Azure OpenAI for task matching

2. **Core Functionality**
   - Fetches meetings from Microsoft Graph API
   - Gets attendance reports for meetings
   - Matches meetings to tasks using direct matching and AI
   - Posts time entries to Intervals
   - Generates reports and statistics

3. **Key Components**
   - File handling for token storage
   - REST API interactions
   - Text processing and cleaning
   - Duration calculations
   - Task context building
   - Report generation

Let's start by creating the Python equivalent. I'll create multiple Python files to maintain a clean structure:

1. First, let's create a requirements.txt file for dependencies:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now, let's create the main configuration file:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now, let's create the utility functions file:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now, let's create the API client for Microsoft Graph:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Now, let's create the Intervals API client:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Now, let's create the task matching module:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_











Now, let's create the main processor class:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_











Finally, let's create the main script:

_**Assistant**_



I've converted the PowerShell script to Python, maintaining all the core functionality while making it more Pythonic and organized. Here's a summary of the changes and improvements:

1. **Modular Structure**:
   - Split the code into multiple files for better organization
   - Created separate classes for different responsibilities
   - Used Python's type hints for better code clarity

2. **Key Components**:
   - `config.py`: Configuration settings
   - `utils.py`: Utility functions
   - `graph_client.py`: Microsoft Graph API client
   - `intervals_client.py`: Intervals API client
   - `task_matcher.py`: Meeting-to-task matching logic
   - `meeting_processor.py`: Main processing logic
   - `main.py`: Entry point

3. **Improvements**:
   - Better error handling
   - More Pythonic code structure
   - Type hints for better IDE support
   - Cleaner class organization
   - Better separation of concerns

To use the script:

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

The script will:
1. Authenticate with Microsoft Graph
2. Get or prompt for Intervals API token
3. Fetch meetings and tasks
4. Process meetings and match them to tasks
5. Post time entries
6. Generate reports

The output will be similar to the PowerShell script, with detailed statistics and exported reports in both text and CSV formats.

_**Assistant**_

I see the error is occurring during the installation of the dependencies, specifically with pandas. The error suggests there's an issue with the build system because Visual Studio components are missing. Let's fix this by:

1. First, let's modify our requirements to use a pre-built wheel for pandas instead of building from source:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now, let's try installing the dependencies again. Run this command in your terminal:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see we're still having issues with pandas installation. Let's try a different approach. The error indicates we need Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools. Instead of building from source, let's try installing pandas using a pre-built wheel from a different source:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Let's try installing the latest version of pandas that's available as a pre-built wheel:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Now let's install the remaining dependencies:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Great! All the dependencies are now installed. Let's try running the script:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







I see there's an authentication error with MSAL. Let's fix the authentication code in the `graph_client.py` file:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_











Now let's try running the script again:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**User**_

Authentication completed. You can close this window now.

---

_**Assistant**_

I see you've completed the authentication in the browser window. Let's continue running the script to process your meetings. The script should now have an access token and continue with fetching and processing your meetings.

Let's run the script again:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see that the Microsoft Graph authentication was successful, but we're having an issue with the Intervals API authentication. The error suggests that the provided token might be incorrect or there might be an issue with the Intervals API connection.

Let's check the Intervals API client code and make sure we're formatting the token correctly:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Now let's try running the script again with the improved error handling:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







I see the issue now. The Intervals API response structure is slightly different from what we expected. Let's update the Intervals client to handle the response format correctly:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_











Now let's try running the script again with the corrected Intervals API client:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Great! The script is now working correctly. Here's what happened:

1. Successfully authenticated with both Microsoft Graph and Intervals API
2. Retrieved and processed 7 meetings
3. Successfully matched 6 out of 7 meetings to tasks (85.7% match rate)
4. Posted 6 time entries (100% post success rate for matched meetings)
5. Generated detailed reports in both TXT and CSV formats

The task matching worked well, with meetings being correctly matched to their corresponding tasks:
- Daily status meetings → Daily Status Report task
- UMG-related meeting → UMG Task
- Western Digital meeting → WD Task
- Infrastructure-related meetings → Infra Meeting Task

Only one meeting ("Parking Issues in My Home") was not matched to any task, which is correct as it appears to be a personal meeting.

The script has exported two files:
1. `meeting_processing_20241230_005159.txt` - Detailed report
2. `meeting_processing_20241230_005159.csv` - CSV data file

Would you like to review the contents of either report file or make any adjustments to how the meetings are being processed?

---

_**User**_

where is attendee reports

---

_**Assistant**_

I notice that while we're processing the meetings, we're not showing the detailed attendance reports in the output. Let's modify the code to include attendee information in both the console output and the reports.

Let's update the `meeting_processor.py` file to include attendance reporting:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_











Now let's run the script again to see the detailed attendance reports:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







I notice that we're not getting the actual Teams attendance data for any of the meetings. This could be because:

1. The meetings might not be Teams meetings
2. There might be an issue with the attendance report API access
3. The meeting URLs might not be in the correct format

Let's check the meeting data to see if we're getting the Teams meeting information correctly:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_











Let's also modify the meeting fetching to include more meeting details:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_















Now let's run the script again to see the detailed meeting information:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







I see the issue now. The Teams meeting URLs in the response are in a different format than what we're expecting. We need to extract the meeting ID from the URL. Let's update the `get_meeting_attendance` method in `graph_client.py`:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_















Now let's run the script again to see if we can get the attendance data:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I can see that the script is now running successfully

---

_**User**_

dont genrate th csv and read the code carefully @Working Powershell Script.ps1 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the code to remove CSV generation and ensure it aligns with the original PowerShell script. Let me update the `meeting_processor.py` file:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let me also update the `show_statistics` method to remove pandas dependency and simplify the output:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's run the script again to test the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



The script is now running successfully with the following changes:
1. Removed CSV generation and pandas dependency
2. Simplified the task distribution calculation
3. Only generating a single text report file
4. Maintained all the essential functionality from the original PowerShell script

The script successfully:
1. Authenticates with Microsoft Graph
2. Retrieves meetings
3. Attempts to get attendance data (though currently getting 404 errors - this might need investigation)
4. Matches meetings to tasks
5. Posts time entries to Intervals
6. Generates a detailed report in a text file

Would you like me to investigate the attendance report 404 errors or make any other adjustments to the script?

---

_**User**_

Attempts to get attendance data (though currently getting 404 errors - this might need investigation) fix it deep revirew the code @Working Powershell Script.ps1 script

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll analyze the PowerShell script and fix the attendance data retrieval issue in the Python code. The main difference is in how the meeting ID is handled.

Let me update the `graph_client.py` file:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let me also update the `meeting_processor.py` file to handle the attendance data more robustly:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Let's run the script again to test the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I notice that we're still getting 404 errors when trying to retrieve the attendance data. After comparing with the PowerShell script, I see that there are a few key differences in how we're handling the meeting IDs and authentication. Let me update the `graph_client.py` file one more time:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Let's run the script again to test the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I notice that we're still getting 404 errors when trying to retrieve the meeting attendance data. Let me check the PowerShell script to see how it handles the attendance retrieval:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see the issue. In the PowerShell script, when it can't get the attendance report directly, it tries a fallback approach by searching for the meeting using the join URL. Let me update our Python code to match this behavior:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's run the script again to test the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I notice that we're still getting 404 errors when trying to retrieve the meeting attendance data. Let me check the PowerShell script again to see if there are any differences in how it handles the API endpoints:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see the issue. The PowerShell script is using different scopes than our Python code. Let me update our `config.py` file to match the PowerShell script's scopes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see that the scopes are already correct. Let me check how the PowerShell script handles the meeting URL and ID formatting:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







I see the issue. The PowerShell script is using a different approach to get the meeting information. Let me update our Python code to match:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Now let's run the script again to test the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see that we're still getting 404 errors when trying to retrieve attendance data. Let me analyze the PowerShell script to understand how it handles the meeting IDs and attendance data retrieval.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see the issue now. Looking at the PowerShell script, it handles the meeting ID and attendance data retrieval differently. Let me update the `get_meeting_attendance` method in `graph_client.py` to match the PowerShell implementation:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's add the missing imports at the top of the file:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Let's run the script again to test the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







I apologize for removing the `msal` import. Let's add it back:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Now let's run the script again:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Let me run it again:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**User**_

check the code i hope you will understand it

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me analyze the PowerShell script more carefully. I notice that in the PowerShell script, the attendance data retrieval is done using the user's ID directly from the Graph API, not the email address. Let me modify the code to match this approach:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's run the script again to test these changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see the error now. We need to initialize the session in the `GraphClient` class. Let me update the `__init__` method:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Now let's run the script again to test the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**User**_

check again how its works

---

_**Assistant**_

I notice that in the PowerShell script, it's using `$TargetUser.id` directly from the Graph API response, while in our Python code we're making an extra call to `/me` and using `userPrincipalName`. Let me update the code to match the PowerShell implementation:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Now let's run the script again to test these changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see that we're getting some attendance data now! The script is successfully retrieving attendance reports for meetings where the current user is the organizer, but we're still getting 403 Forbidden errors for meetings where the user is not the organizer.

Let me check the PowerShell script again to see how it handles meetings with different organizers:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see the issue now. In the PowerShell script, when retrieving attendance reports, it uses the current user's ID for both the organizer and attendee queries. Let me update the Python code to match this behavior:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's run the script again to test the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see that we're having an issue with the URL decoding. Let me fix that in the `get_meeting_attendance` method:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Now let's run the script again to test the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







I see that we're now successfully getting attendance data for meetings where the current user is the organizer, but we're still getting 403 Forbidden errors for meetings where someone else is the organizer. Let me check the PowerShell script again to see how it handles this:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see the issue now. In the PowerShell script, when there's an error getting the attendance report, it falls back to using the scheduled duration and creates a default attendance record. Let me update the Python code to match this behavior:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now I need to update the `meeting_processor.py` file to pass the start and end times to the `get_meeting_attendance` method:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's run the script again to test the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see the command was interrupted. Let's try again:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**User**_

stuck i think

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you get unstuck. I see that the script is getting interrupted when asking about using the saved Intervals token. Let's try running it again and make sure to respond to the prompts:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see the issue now. There's a mismatch in how we're calling `get_meeting_attendance()`. In the `get_user_meetings()` method of `graph_client.py`, we're not passing the required `start_time` and `end_time` arguments. Let me fix that:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Now let's run the script again to test the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see two issues:

1. We're getting 403 Forbidden errors for meetings where we're not the organizer, but that's expected and we're handling it correctly by falling back to scheduled duration.

2. We have a method name mismatch. The error shows that we're trying to call `match_meeting_to_task` but it doesn't exist. Let me fix that:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Now let's run the script again:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I notice there's an error in the script execution:

```
Error in main process: 'MeetingProcessor' object has no attribute 'tasks'
Error: 'MeetingProcessor' object has no attribute 'tasks'
```

This error occurs because we're trying to access `self.tasks` in the `process_meeting` method, but the `tasks` attribute hasn't been properly initialized. Let me fix this issue by examining the code:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see the issue. The `tasks` attribute is being used in the `process_meeting` method but it's not being initialized anywhere. Let me fix this by adding task initialization in the `initialize` method:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's run the script again to test the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now we have another error:
```
Error in main process: 'IntervalsClient' object has no attribute 'user_id'
```

Let me check the `intervals_client.py` file to fix this issue:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see the issue. The `IntervalsClient` class stores the user information in `self.current_user` but doesn't have a dedicated `user_id` property. Let me fix this by adding a property to access the user ID:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Now let's run the script again to test the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



The script is now running successfully! The main issues have been fixed:
1. The `tasks` attribute is now properly initialized in the `MeetingProcessor` class
2. The `user_id` property is now correctly implemented in the `IntervalsClient` class

There are still some minor issues to address:
1. We're seeing some 403 Forbidden errors when trying to get attendance reports for meetings where we're not the organizer
2. There's an error when trying to export results: `Error exporting results: 'scheduled_duration'`
3. Some time entries are being posted twice (we see "Successfully posted time entry" appearing twice for some meetings)

Let me fix these issues one by one. First, let's look at the duplicate time entry posting:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see the issue. We have two methods that are both displaying attendance reports and posting time entries:
1. `show_attendance_report` - This method displays attendance data and returns a dictionary with attendance information
2. `process_meeting` - This method also displays attendance data and posts time entries

We need to consolidate these methods to avoid duplication. Let me update the code:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's run the script again to test the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**User**_

for now focus on only attendees report okey

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand you want to focus on the attendance reporting functionality. Let me help you with that. First, I'll check the `show_attendance_report` method in the `meeting_processor.py` file since it seems to be missing:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's run the script to see the attendance report in action:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see that we're still getting the error about `'MeetingProcessor' object has no attribute 'tasks'`. Let me fix this by initializing the `tasks` attribute in the `MeetingProcessor` class:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now I need to update the `initialize` method to properly set up these attributes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's run the script again to see if the attendance reporting works properly:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Great! The attendance reporting is now working properly. Let me summarize what we can see from the attendance reports:

1. For each meeting, we're showing:
   - Meeting title
   - Start and end times
   - Scheduled duration
   - List of attendees with their:
     - Name and email
     - Actual attendance duration
     - Attendance percentage relative to scheduled duration

2. We're seeing two types of attendance data:
   - For meetings where we can get attendance data:
     - Shows actual attendee names and emails
     - Shows their individual attendance durations
     - Calculates attendance percentage
   - For meetings where we can't get attendance data:
     - Falls back to using the scheduled duration
     - Shows "Unknown User" with the user ID

3. Some interesting attendance patterns:
   - Some meetings had over 100% attendance (e.g., Annual Day Meeting with 264.6% for one attendee)
   - Some meetings had very low attendance (e.g., Parking Issues meeting with 12.7% and 8.2%)
   - We're seeing both organizer and attendee data where available

4. There are some 403 Forbidden errors when trying to get attendance data for certain meetings, but the system gracefully falls back to using scheduled duration in these cases.

The attendance reporting is functioning as intended, providing detailed information about meeting participation while handling cases where attendance data isn't available. Would you like me to make any adjustments to how the attendance information is displayed?

---

_**User**_

now you have successfully retrive the attendee data now focus on to make better format so that normal user see it propley  refer this code 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you improve the formatting of the attendance report to match the PowerShell script's style. I'll update the `show_attendance_report` method to make it more visually appealing:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's run the script to see the improved formatting:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



The attendance report formatting has been improved with:

1. Clear visual separation using borders (=====)
2. Better aligned and structured information
3. Standardized time format (HH:MM:SS)
4. Categorized attendance percentages (Excellent/Good/Below Expected)
5. Sorted attendees by duration
6. Cleaner spacing and organization

Would you like me to make any additional improvements to the formatting? For example, we could:

1. Add color coding (though this would only work in terminals that support ANSI colors)
2. Add more visual separators between sections
3. Include additional statistics like average attendance
4. Change the format of any specific sections

Let me know what other improvements you'd like to see!

---

_**User**_

make more refine output understand the code how can we refine our ouput

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at both the PowerShell and Python code, I can help refine the output to make it more user-friendly and informative. Let's update the `show_attendance_report` method with better formatting:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Now let's run the script to see the improved formatting:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I can see that the attendance report formatting has been significantly improved with the following features:

1. Clear visual separation using box-drawing characters (╔═╗║╚╝)
2. Organized sections with emoji icons:
   - 📅 Meeting Details
   - 👥 Attendance Details
   - 📊 Meeting Summary

3. Detailed information for each meeting:
   - Subject with relevant emoji
   - Start and end times
   - Scheduled duration
   - Individual attendee details with attendance percentage
   - Color-coded attendance status (✨ Excellent, ⚠️ Below Expected)

4. Summary statistics:
   - Total attendees
   - Average attendance
   - Meeting effectiveness status

5. Processing results:
   - Task matching information
   - Billable hours calculation
   - Time entry posting status

The output is now much more readable and provides clear visual feedback about meeting attendance and effectiveness. The script successfully processed 7 meetings, matched 6 of them to tasks, and posted 5 time entries, with a match success rate of 85.7%.

Would you like me to make any further improvements to the formatting or add any additional information to the report?

1. The attendance report formatting is now more visually appealing with clear sections and emojis
2. The current user's name and email are being displayed correctly in most cases
3. The meeting summaries include detailed statistics about attendance percentages
4. The task matching and time entry posting is working as expected for most meetings

However, there are still a few issues to note:

1. Some meetings are still getting 403 Forbidden errors when trying to access attendance reports
2. There's still an "Unknown User" showing up in some cases
3. There's an error exporting results related to 'attendee_count'

Would you like me to help address any of these remaining issues?

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the Python code to use email addresses instead of user IDs in the attendance report. Let me update the `show_attendance_report` method in `meeting_processor.py`:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I've updated the `show_attendance_report` method to match the PowerShell script's formatting. The key changes include:

1. Using email addresses instead of user IDs
2. Simplified the formatting to match the PowerShell script's style
3. Removed emojis and fancy borders
4. Changed the duration display format to show minutes
5. Added "Exact attendance time" display
6. Using only the first name for the attendee display
7. Adjusted the overall layout to match the PowerShell script's output

Let's run the script to test these changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



The output now matches the PowerShell script's format more closely. However, there's still one issue where "Unknown User" appears with a user ID instead of an email address. Let me fix that in the `process_meeting` method:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Let's run the script again to test the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



There's still one more place where we need to fix the "Unknown User" issue. Let me update the `show_attendance_report` method to ensure it always uses the current user's information:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Let's run the script one final time to verify all the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



The script has run successfully with the improved formatting and user information display. Let's analyze the key improvements and remaining issues:

1. **Successful Changes:**
   - The attendance report now shows a clear header section with meeting details
   - Attendee information is properly formatted with name, email, duration, and attendance percentage
   - The report includes actual duration and billable hours calculations
   - Task matching and time entry posting are working correctly for most meetings

2. **Remaining Issues:**
   - Some meetings still show "Unknown User" when there's a 403 Forbidden error accessing attendance data
   - There are a few API request errors when trying to access attendance reports
   - One meeting had an error posting the time entry due to a Bad Request

3. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Total Meetings Processed: 7
   - Successfully Matched: 6 (85.7% success rate)
   - Time Entries Posted: 5 (83.3% success rate)
   - Total Billable Hours: 2.7 hours

Would you like me to help address any of these remaining issues or make further improvements to the formatting?

_**User**_

we have to fix this issue Some meetings still show "Unknown User" when there's a 403 Forbidden error accessing attendance data

till then dont post to intervals ok and dont create txt file okey  , we will fix this unknown user issue first

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand. Let's focus on fixing the "Unknown User" issue when we encounter 403 Forbidden errors. I'll check the code where this occurs.

Looking at the code, this issue appears in two places:

1. In `graph_client.py` when attendance data can't be retrieved
2. In `meeting_processor.py` when handling meetings without attendance data

Let's modify the code to handle these cases better by using the current user's information instead of "Unknown User".

I'll edit the `meeting_processor.py` file first:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's update the `graph_client.py` file to handle the 403 error case better:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's modify the `process_meeting` method in `meeting_processor.py` to temporarily disable posting to Intervals:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Finally, let's update the `run` method to disable the file export:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I've made the following changes to fix the "Unknown User" issue and temporarily disable Intervals posting and file export:

1. In `meeting_processor.py`:
   - Updated `show_attendance_report` to always use the current user's full name
   - Modified the handling of missing or "Unknown User" cases to use current user info
   - Disabled posting to Intervals in `process_meeting`
   - Disabled file export in `run`

2. In `graph_client.py`:
   - Added better handling of 403 errors
   - Updated the fallback case to use current user information from the /me endpoint
   - Improved error handling to always provide user information

Let's run the script to test these changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Great! The changes have successfully fixed the "Unknown User" issue. Now when we encounter a 403 Forbidden error or missing attendance data, the script correctly shows:

1. The current user's full name (e.g., "Rajesh Alda" instead of "Unknown User")
2. The correct email format (e.g., "rajeshalda@M365x65088219.onmicrosoft.com")
3. Proper attendance duration based on the scheduled meeting time

The script is also correctly:
- Not posting to Intervals (as requested)
- Not creating text files
- Showing proper attendance reports with user information

Would you like me to make any additional improvements to the user information display or handle any other issues?

---

_**User**_

 nice work bro 😎 well done

---

_**Assistant**_

Thank you! I'm glad I could help improve the script. The main improvements we achieved were:

1. Fixed the "Unknown User" issue by properly using the current user's information
2. Improved the attendance report formatting with clear sections and better readability
3. Added proper error handling for 403 Forbidden errors
4. Temporarily disabled Intervals posting and file exports as requested
5. Added proper sorting of attendees by duration
6. Improved the display of attendance percentages and durations

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with? I can assist with:
- Further formatting improvements
- Additional error handling
- Other features or modifications you might need

---

_**User**_

now its time to fix the Post intervals

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix the posting to Intervals. Let's re-enable and improve the posting functionality in the `process_meeting` method.

Let me check the current implementation:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I'll help you fix the Intervals posting functionality. Looking at the code, I see that we need to:

1. Re-enable posting to Intervals in the `process_meeting` method
2. Format the time entry correctly with all required fields
3. Add proper error handling for the posting

Let me modify the `process_meeting` method:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's run the script to test the Intervals posting:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see there's an error in the script. The `to_intervals_date` function is not defined but is being used in the `process_meeting` method. Let me fix this by adding the necessary date conversion function.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's run the script again to test the Intervals posting with the date conversion function in place:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Great! The script is now successfully posting time entries to Intervals. Let's analyze what happened:

1. The date conversion function `to_intervals_date` is working correctly.
2. The script successfully processed 7 meetings:
   - 6 meetings were matched to tasks
   - 5 time entries were successfully posted
   - 1 meeting had no task match
   - 1 time entry failed to post (0.0 hours was rejected by Intervals)

3. Task Distribution:
   - Daily Status Report: 2 entries
   - UMG Task: 1 entry
   - WD Task: 1 entry
   - Infra Meeting Task: 1 entry

4. Total billable hours: 2.7 hours

The only issue was with the "03-NOV-24 Meeting 🍕" which had a duration of 0.0 hours, causing the Intervals API to reject it with a 400 Bad Request error. This is expected behavior since Intervals doesn't accept time entries with zero duration.

Would you like me to add a check to prevent posting time entries with zero duration to avoid these errors?

---

_**User**_

(0.0 hours was rejected by Intervals) means that the user havent join the meeting . so avoid it to post in interval

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the `process_meeting` method to skip posting time entries when the billable hours are 0. Let me update the code:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's run the script to test the changes:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Great! The changes are working as expected. Now when a meeting has zero billable hours (like the "03-NOV-24 Meeting 🍕" which had only 2 minutes of attendance), the script skips posting to Intervals and marks it as "Zero Duration" instead.

Here's what happened in the latest run:
1. Total meetings processed: 7
2. Successfully matched: 5
3. Time entries posted: 5 (all successful, no more 400 Bad Request errors)
4. Unmatched meetings: 2
   - One had no task match
   - One had zero duration

The task distribution looks good:
- Daily Status Report: 2 entries
- UMG Task: 1 entry
- WD Task: 1 entry
- Infra Meeting Task: 1 entry

Total billable hours: 2.7 hours

Would you like me to make any other improvements to the script?

Make sure the redirect URI sent in the request matches one added to your application in the Azure portal. Navigate to https://aka.ms/redirectUriMismatchError to learn more about how to fix this.

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the error - there's a mismatch in the redirect URI. We need to update the redirect URI in both the Azure portal and our application to use `http://127.0.0.1:5001` instead of `http://localhost`.

Let's modify the Microsoft login route to use the correct redirect URI:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now you'll need to:

1. Go to the Azure Portal
2. Navigate to your app registration
3. Under "Authentication" > "Platform configurations" > "Web"
4. Add the redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:5001/auth/microsoft/callback`

After you've added the redirect URI in Azure, try logging in again. The error should be resolved.

Let me know if you need help with any other aspects of the application!
